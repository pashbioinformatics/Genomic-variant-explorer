# Genomic Variant Explorer 🧬

This is my first bioinformatics project, where I analyze a real VCF (genomic variant) dataset using Python.

### 🔍 What this project does:
- Loads a public VCF file
- Filters variants by gene, chromosome, or impact level
- Creates visualizations of mutation patterns
- Includes biological interpretation of high-impact variants

### 🛠 Tools Used:
- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### 🚧 Status:
Project in progress — updates coming this week.

### 🌟 About Me:
My name is **Pasheun Perry**, and I am transitioning into Bioinformatics.
