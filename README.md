# Genomic Variant Explorer 🧬

This is my first bioinformatics project, where I analyze a real VCF (genomic variant) dataset using Python.

### 🔍 What this project does:
- Loads a public VCF file
- Filters variants by gene, chromosome, or impact level
- Creates visualizations of mutation patterns
- Includes biological interpretation of high-impact variants

### 🛠 Tools Used:
- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### 🚧 Status:
Project in progress — updates coming this week.

### 🌟 About Me:
My name is **Pasheun Perry**, and I am transitioning into Bioinformatics.
Follow my journey into genomics, Python workflows, and computational biology.

📁 R Basics Practice (New Folder Added)

This repository now includes a new folder: R_basics_practice/, where I’m learning the foundations of R for genomics and Bioconductor workflows.

🔍 What’s Inside

loading_and_viewing_data.R
A beginner-friendly R script where I practice:
	•	Loading built-in datasets (iris, mtcars, ToothGrowth)
	•	Viewing the first rows with head()
	•	Inspecting structure with str()
	•	Getting quick summary statistics with summary()

This script shows my progress toward becoming fluent in R, which is essential for genomic data analysis, RNA-seq workflows, and Bioconductor modules.

🎯 Why This Matters for Bioinformatics

Learning R is a core requirement for:
	•	Working with gene expression matrices
	•	Running DESeq2 / edgeR for differential expression
	•	Using GenomicRanges for genomic intervals
	•	Importing FASTA/VCF/expression data
	•	Reproducing published workflows in Bioconductor

This folder documents my step-by-step progression as I prepare for Harvard’s Introduction to Bioconductor for Genomics course.

📌 Next Steps in My R Learning Roadmap
	•	Add a script for importing CSV and FASTA files
	•	Create a histogram + summary stats mini-project in R
	•	Build Project 2: Gene Expression Analysis in R
	•	Begin using ggplot2, Biostrings, and SummarizedExperiment objects
