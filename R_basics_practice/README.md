# R Basics Practice

This folder contains beginner R exercises I’m completing as part of my bioinformatics transition.

## Scripts Included

### 1. loading_and_viewing_data.R
- Loads built-in datasets (`iris`, `mtcars`, `ToothGrowth`)
- Views first rows using `head()`
- Checks structure with `str()`
- Summarizes data with `summary()`

More R scripts coming soon as I learn:
- ggplot2 visualizations
- Bioconductor basics
- ExpressionSet & SummarizedExperiment handling
